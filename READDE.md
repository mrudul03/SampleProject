Newman

Newman is a
command line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to run and test a
Postman Collection directly from the command line.

Installing Newman

Newman is built on Node.js. To run Newman, you need to have
Node.js installed. Node.js can be downloaded and installed from https://nodejs.org/download/ 

Once Node.js is installed, install Newman from npm globally
on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere.

$ npm
install -g newman

Running Newman

Run Newman with a Postman collection file on a local machine.
Collections created in Postman can be exported as .json file.

$ newman run
userprofile-composite-collection.json

Run Newman with a collection as a URL.

$ newman run
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/cb208e7e64056f5294e5 

The environment variables created in Postman can be exported
and passed with –e flag

Options

Newman provides various options to run a Postman collection.

Some handy options:

Use the -n option to set the number of iterations to run the
collection.

$ newman run userprofile-composite-collection.json -n 10  # runs the collection 10 times

Use the -d to specify a JSON or CSV data file, to ptovide
different sets of data

$ newman run mycollection.json -d data.json

Use the -e to provide environment variables

$ newman run
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/cb208e7e64056f5294e5 -e
dev_environment.json

File Uploads

The file to be uploaded must be placed in the relative
location specified within the collection.

 

Postman Scripts

Pre-request Scripts

Pre-request scripts are snippets of code associated with a
collection request that are executed before the request is sent. A perfect
example of pre-request script would be to extract a resource id for example userprofileId
from POST response and set the same as an environment variable and use the same
as {{userprofileId}}
in subsequent requests.

Pre-request scripts can be added to a collection, a folder,
or a single request within a collection.

Test Scripts

Test script is essentially a JavaScript code executed after
the request is sent, allowing access to the pm.response object.



// example using pm.response.to.have

pm.test("response is ok",
function () {

   
pm.response.to.have.status(200);

});
